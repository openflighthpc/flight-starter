  SYNOPSIS:

  DESCRIPTION:

    Show some brief help about the ${flight_STARTER_product} environment.

+==== Welcome to ${flight_STARTER_product}. ====}

${flight_STARTER_product} provides a suite of tools to facilitate working with your high performance computing (HPC) or research compute environment.

+== Activation ==}

By default when you log in to your environment ${flight_STARTER_product} is not activated.  This gives you the choice to opt in to its features, or to otherwise use your preferred tools to manage and interact with your environment.

To activate ${flight_STARTER_product}, execute:

  ^flight start}

Once activated, your environment will be configured to operate with ${flight_STARTER_product} and the 'flight' command will provide access to the toolkit.

+== Customization ==}

You may configure the behaviour of ${flight_STARTER_product} on log in to your environment using the 'flight set' command:

 * To suppress the 'flight' command hints displayed when you log in,
   execute:

     ^flight set hints off}

 * To suppress the welcome message entirely, execute:

     ^flight set welcome off}

 * To disable ${flight_STARTER_product} start up for interactive
   subshells, execute:

     ^flight set secondary off}

 * To automatically have ${flight_STARTER_product} enabled when you log
   in, execute:

     ^flight set always on}

You can toggle these settings 'on' or 'off' at any time.

+== Further help ==}

Once the ${flight_STARTER_product} environment is active, you can use the 'flight help' command to get help about specific tools.
