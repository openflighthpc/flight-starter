  SYNOPSIS:

    $flight_NAME start [--subshell]

  DESCRIPTION:

    Activate the ${flight_STARTER_product} environment.

    This is a no-op if the environment has already been activated.

    Note that you will receive an message to state the environment is
    already activated within an interactive shell session, but for
    non-interactive shells sessions, no message will be emitted.  This
    command will always exit with an exit code of 0 (success).

    If you are using direct invocation, you may specify the
    '--subshell' option to launch a subshell with the environment
    activated.
